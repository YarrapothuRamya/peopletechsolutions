                <ul class="mb-4">
                    <li>Purpose: Protecting the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data transmitted over networks.</li>
                    <li>Technologies: Firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), VPNs (Virtual Private Networks), and network segmentation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Data Security</strong></p>
                <ul class="mb-4">
                    <li>Purpose: Safeguarding data from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction throughout its lifecycle.</li>
                    <li>Techniques: Encryption (at rest and in transit), data masking, access controls, and data loss prevention (DLP) solutions.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Endpoint Security</strong></p>
                <ul class="mb-4">
                    <li>Purpose: Securing end-user devices (e.g., laptops, mobile devices) from malicious activities and vulnerabilities.</li>
                    <li>Tools: Antivirus software, endpoint detection and response (EDR), and mobile device management (MDM) solutions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Identity and Access Management (IAM)</strong></p>

                    <li>Purpose: Managing and controlling user access to systems, applications, and data resources.</li>
                    <li>Practices: Multi-factor authentication (MFA), single sign-on (SSO), role-based access control (RBAC), and privileged access management (PAM).</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Security Monitoring and Incident Response</strong></p>
                <ul class="mb-4">
                    <li>Purpose: Detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents in real-time to minimize impact.</li>
                    <li>Capabilities: Security information and event management (SIEM), threat intelligence, and automated incident response tools.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Application Security</strong></p>
                <ul class="mb-4">
                    <li>Purpose: Ensuring the security of software applications against vulnerabilities and attacks.</li>
                    <li>Practices: Secure coding practices, vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and application security testing (AST).</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-2"><strong>Cloud Security</strong></p>
                <ul class="mb-4">
                    <li>Purpose: Protecting data, applications, and infrastructure hosted in cloud environments.</li>
                    <li>Considerations: Shared responsibility model, encryption, access controls, and cloud security posture management (CSPM) tools.</li>
